// Coding challenges:
// Create a new github repo named coding-challenges (or whatever suitable name you would like) and a folder with the same name on your computer;
// Connect your local folder with the github repo (you need to run git init, then git remote add origin)
// Create two branches for each challenge below; once you are done with the code push to github and merge into master. (you will have two branches merged into master);
// 1. Write a function that takes three arguments - all numbers - adds them together, split the result in 3 and displays the result on the console.
